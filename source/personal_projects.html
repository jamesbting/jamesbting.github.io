        <!--Sudoku game box-->
        <h2>Sudoku Game</h2>
        <h4>December 2019 - Present</h4>
        <p>
          I created a Sudoku game in Python, which includes a GUI, automatic solver, 
          stopwatch and a game generator.
          <br>
          <br>
          The GUI and the stopwatch were built using the Tkinter module. The solver employed a recursive
          backtracking algorithim to test possible solutions to the board, and then eliminate those that would
          not lead to a valid soution.

          <!-- My website box-->
          <h2>My Website</h2>
          <h4>December 2019 - Present</h4>
          <p>
            I built a website to learn my HTML and CSS skills and to showcase my resume in another manner. The website is actually the one you are reading right now. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This website was built to be an online resume, and hosted on Amazon Web Services. In the future, I hope to host it on my Raspberry Pi 4, which would give me expeirence in both front-end and back-end
            development.

          <!--Login System box--> 
        <h2>Login System</h2>
        <h4>November 2019 - Present</h4>
        <p>
          I created a login system in Python, which includes a GUI, a database to store all the usernames, and lets users create accounts, change passwords, and login.
          <br>
          <br>
          This project was my first personal project I had ever created. I had planned it to be a simple program that let me practice file IO and OOD in Python, but would not include a GUI and the user was
          expected to interact with the console.
          <br>
          <br>
          Upon learning about cryptographic hash functions, I had wanted to apply that to the login system, and be done with it. In the end, I added a GUI (built using Tkinter) a SHA-256 encryption algorithim,
          and a database to store all the account informations.
