        <h2>strike_pose: Pose similarity detection</h2>

        <p>
          As part of a team of 4 developers, I used wrnchAI's pose detection algorithm to build a model that can determine if 2 poses are similar or not.
          <br>
          <br>
          I was responsible for integrating the algorithm with the similarity model.
