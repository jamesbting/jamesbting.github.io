          <h2>Computer Science Student - McGill University</h2>
          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>
            I am a second-year Computer Science student at McGill University. I hope to secure an internship where I will be able to showcase and refine my skills in various aspects of software
              development. I am especially interested in machine learning and its applications. However, I hope to explore more aspects of computer science in the hopes of discovering more topics that I'm passionate about.
              <br>
              <br>
              When I am not studying or coding, I am exploring Montreal to discover new and interesting foods or soaring in the sky in a Cessna 172.

          <h2>Sudoku Game</h2>
          <h4>December 2019 - Present</h4>
          <p>
            I created a Sudoku game in Python, which includes a GUI, automatic solver, 
            stopwatch and a game generator.
            <br>
            <br>
            The GUI and the stopwatch were built using the Tkinter module. The solver employed a recursive
            backtracking algorithim to test possible solutions to the board, and then eliminate those that would
            not lead to a valid soution.

            <!-- My website box-->
            <h2>My Website</h2>
            <h4>December 2019 - Present</h4>
            <p>
              I built a website to learn my HTML and CSS skills and to showcase my resume in another manner. The website is actually the one you are reading right now. 
              <br>
              <br>
              This website was built to be an online resume, and hosted on Amazon Web Services. In the future, I hope to host it on my Raspberry Pi 4, which would give me expeirence in both front-end and back-end
              development.

            <!--Login System box--> 
          <h2>Login System</h2>
          <h4>November 2019 - Present</h4>
          <p>
            I created a login system in Python, which includes a GUI, a database to store all the usernames, and lets users create accounts, change passwords, and login.
            <br>
            <br>
            This project was my first personal project I had ever created. I had planned it to be a simple program that let me practice file IO and OOD in Python, but would not include a GUI and the user was
            expected to interact with the console.
            <br>
            <br>
            Upon learning about cryptographic hash functions, I had wanted to apply that to the login system, and be done with it. In the end, I added a GUI (built using Tkinter) a SHA-256 encryption algorithim,
            and a database to store all the account informations.

            I created a 2d dungeon crawler game in Java called Rouge Dungeon in collaboration with 2 other classmates. The purpose of this game was to explore developing user interfaces and practice object-oriented
            design.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was responsible for graphics and the sound design of the game.

          In November of 2019, I was promoted to the club's VP Technology. As the VP Technology, I am responsible for ensuring that the club uses to technology to deliver events where students 
          can explore Hong Kong food, language and culture.
          <br>
          <br>
          During my time as VP Technology, I hope to develop a new and improved website for the club, and an automated text confirmation system for ticket orders.
