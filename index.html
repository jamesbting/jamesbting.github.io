            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>I am a Computer Science student at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Growing up in Vancouver, I've had a passion for technology
              and software. From jailbreaking iPhones and flashing custom software onto my Android phone, to training neural networks, I am always looking
              for opportunities to learn more about software, and I look forward to seeing what the future brings.
            </p>
            <p> I am especially interested machine learning and its applications in other fields, such as aerospace,
            cyber security, and social activism.</p>

            <h3>What languages and technologies have you worked with?</h3>

            <p>
            I have experience working with Java, Python,C, Javascript, HTML and CSS across multiple environments including Windows and Linux (Ubuntu and Raspbian OS).
            In terms of libraries, I have worked with Tensorflow, PyTorch, Matplotlib, and SQLite to name a few. 
            </p>

            <h3>What do I do in your free time?</h3>
            <p>When I am not studying or coding, I am exploring Montreal to discover new and interesting foods to eat, 
            or soaring in the high in the sky in a Cessna 172.</p>
