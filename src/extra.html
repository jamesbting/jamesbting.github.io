      <h2>Co-President - Hong Kong Student Network</h2>
      <h4>April 2020 - Present</h4>
      <p>
      As the Co-President of the Hong Kong Student Network, I am responsible for leading the club throughout the year. I am primarily responsible for the Internal,
      External, Finance and Communications teams. 
      </p>
      <p>
      In these unprecedented times, I was elected to lead the club in a time where there is no pre-existing framework of what the club's response to this pandemic.
      To protect the health and safety of other executive members, and by extension the general public, the co-presidents have decided to suspend all in-person events
      and meetings, and will continue to follow the social distancing guidelines set out by local, provincial and federal governments.

      <p>
        As part of a team of 4 developers, I used wrnchAI's pose detection algorithm to build a model that can determine if 2 poses are similar or not.
      </p>
      <p> 
        I was responsible for integrating the algorithm with the similarity model, by taking the results of the algorithm and giving them to the model.

      I created a 2d dungeon crawler game in Java called Rouge Dungeon in collaboration with 2 other classmates. The purpose of this game was to explore developing user interfaces and practice object-oriented
      design.
