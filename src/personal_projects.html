      <h4>July 2020</h4>
      <p>
        I developed a web application that allows for users to develop their own superhero team, and determine the stats for each superhero. 
        The superhero data is pulled from the Superhero API, a RESTful API,that contains data about superheros from both the Marvel and DC universes.

        The example below is a single-view version of the application, but the actual application is now a multi-view application.

      <h4>June 2020</h4>
      <p>
      I built a programming language, with tokens, a lexer, a parser and a visitor written in C. Fluent-C is an interpreted language, since building a compiler is
      beyond my current skill set. At the moment, it has support for strings and functions, with support for arithmetic operations being worked on at the moment.
      <br>
      I chose C since it is a fast, relatively low-level language, and this is my first project written in C.

      <h4>June 2020 - Present</h4>
      <p>
        I built a <b>pathfinding algorithm visualizer</b> using <b>React library</b> to learn about the <b>React library</b> as well as 
        pathfinding algorithms in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are currently 5 algorithms available to visualize: Dijktra's Algorithm, A * Search, Depth First Search (Iterative and Recursive), and Breadth First Search.
        Currently, the next step is to add an algorithm that will automatically generate a maze for the user to see the algorithms in action

      <h2>League of Legends Match Outcome prediction with Deep Learning</h2>

      <h3>Deep Learning, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Riot API</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>May 2020</h4>
      <p>
      I built a <b>Binary Classification Neural Network</b> using the <b>PyTorch library</b>, and trained it to predict the outcomes
      of League of Legends games, based on each participant's stats. I achieved approximately <b>92% validation accuracy</b> on post-match data,
      on a dataset of over 10 000 matches.
      </p>
      <p>
      The dataset was created by me using <b>Riot's API</b> and the <b>RiotWatcher wrapper library</b>. The script that collects the data
      starts with a match, then, for a random summoner in that match, pulls the past match history and then collects the data of that match,
      and continues the process recursively.

      <h3>Recursive Backtracking Algorithms, GUIs</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>December 2019</h4>
      <p>
        I created a Sudoku game in <b>Python</b>, which includes a GUI, automatic solver, 
        stopwatch and a game generator.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GUI and the stopwatch were built using the Tkinter module. The solver employed a <b>recursive backtracking algorithm</b>
        to test possible solutions to the board, and then eliminate those that would
        not lead to a valid solution. This project helped me learn about more types of algorithms beyond those 
        that are typically covered in the classroom, but are nevertheless useful tools.

      <br>
      <h4>November 2019 - January 2020</h4>
        <p>
        I created a login system in <b>Python</b>, which includes a GUI, a database to store all the usernames, 
        and lets users create accounts, change passwords, and login.
        </p>
        <p>
        This project was my first personal project I had ever created. I had planned it to be a simple program that 
        let me practice <b>file IO</b> and <b>OOD</b> in Python, but would not include a GUI and the user was expected to 
        interact with the console.
        </p>
        <p>
        Upon learning about cryptographic hash functions, I had wanted to apply that to the login system,
        and be done with it. In the end, I added a GUI (built using <b>Tkinter</b>) a <b>SHA-256 encryption</b> algorithm,
        and a <b>SQLite3</b> database to store all the account information.
