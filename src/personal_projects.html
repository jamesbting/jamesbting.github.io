          <h2>League of Legends Match Outcome prediction with Deep Learning<i class="fas fa-globe"></i></h2>
          <h3>Deep Learning, PyTorch, Riot API</h3>
          <h4>May 2020 - Present</h4>
          <p>
            I built a Binary Classification Neural Network using the PyTorch library, and trained it to predict the outcomes
            of League of Legends games, based on each participant's stats. I achieved approximately 92% validation accuracy,
            on a dataset of approximately 3403 matches.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dataset was created by me using Riot's API and the RiotWatcher wrapper library. The script that collects the data
            starts with a match, then, for a random summoner in that match, pulls the past match history and then collects the data of that match,
            and continues the process recursively

            I built a website to learn my <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> skills and to showcase my resume in another manner. 
            The website is actually the one you are reading right now.

            I am in the process of refactoring the web page to make it compatible with mobile and tablet devices. If you have the chance, feel free to

           <h2>Sudoku Game <i class="fas fa-chess-board"></i></h2>
           <h3>Backtracking Algorithms, GUIs</h3>
           <h4>December 2019</h4>
           <p>
             I created a Sudoku game in <b>Python</b>, which includes a GUI, automatic solver, 
             stopwatch and a game generator.
           </p>
           <p>
             The GUI and the stopwatch were built using the Tkinter module. The solver employed a <b>recursive backtracking algorithm</b>
             to test possible solutions to the board, and then eliminate those that would
             not lead to a valid solution. This project helped me learn about more types of algorithms beyond those 
             that are typically covered in the classroom, but are nevertheless useful tools.

          <h3>Cybersecurity, Databases, GUIs</h3>
          <h4>November 2019 - January 2020</h4>
            <p>
            I created a login system in <b>Python</b>, which includes a GUI, a database to store all the usernames, 
            and lets users create accounts, change passwords, and login.
            </p>
            <p>
            This project was my first personal project I had ever created. I had planned it to be a simple program that 
            let me practice <b>file IO and OOD</b> in Python, but would not include a GUI and the user was expected to 
            interact with the console.
            </p>
            <p>
            Upon learning about cryptographic hash functions, I had wanted to apply that to the login system,
            and be done with it. In the end, I added a GUI (built using <b>Tkinter</b>) a <b>SHA-256 encryption</b> algorithm,
            and a <b>SQLite3</b> database to store all the account information.
