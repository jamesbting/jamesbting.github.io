      <h3>Deep Learning, PyTorch, Riot API</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>May 2020 - Present</h4>
      <p>
      I built a <b>Binary Classification Neural Network</b> using the <b>PyTorch library</b>, and trained it to predict the outcomes
      of League of Legends games, based on each participant's stats. I achieved approximately <b>92% validation accuracy</b>,
      on a dataset of approximately 4759 matches.
      </p>
      <p>
      The dataset was created by me using <b>Riot's API</b> and the <b>RiotWatcher wrapper library</b>. The script that collects the data
      starts with a match, then, for a random summoner in that match, pulls the past match history and then collects the data of that match,
      and continues the process recursively.

      <h3>Backtracking Algorithms, GUIs</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>December 2019</h4>
      <p>
        I created a Sudoku game in <b>Python</b>, which includes a GUI, automatic solver, 
        stopwatch and a game generator.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GUI and the stopwatch were built using the Tkinter module. The solver employed a <b>recursive backtracking algorithm</b>
        to test possible solutions to the board, and then eliminate those that would
        not lead to a valid solution. This project helped me learn about more types of algorithms beyond those 
        that are typically covered in the classroom, but are nevertheless useful tools.

      <h3>Cybersecurity, Databases, GUIs</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>November 2019 - January 2020</h4>
        <p>
        I created a login system in <b>Python</b>, which includes a GUI, a database to store all the usernames, 
        and lets users create accounts, change passwords, and login.
        </p>
        <p>
        This project was my first personal project I had ever created. I had planned it to be a simple program that 
        let me practice <b>file IO</b> and <b>OOD</b> in Python, but would not include a GUI and the user was expected to 
        interact with the console.
        </p>
        <p>
        Upon learning about cryptographic hash functions, I had wanted to apply that to the login system,
        and be done with it. In the end, I added a GUI (built using <b>Tkinter</b>) a <b>SHA-256 encryption</b> algorithm,
        and a <b>SQLite3</b> database to store all the account information.
